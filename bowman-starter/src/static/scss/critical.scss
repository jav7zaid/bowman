/*
  Inline css that is critical to
  initial page rendering
  for optimal performance

  For simplicity we inline this
  in every single page within
  <style></style> tags inside
  <head></head>

  We also leave critical css duplicated
  inside our app css entrypoint
  for simplification and because
  this will be cached by browsers anyways
